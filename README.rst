Melee Practice
==============
.. image:: About/Preview.png

A quality-of-life mod for Rimworld.

Mark pawns or animals as victims. Mark other pawns as bullies. The bullies will practice their melee skill against the victims on a regular basis.

* Bullies will only melee victims when the victims are fully healed of all non-permanent injuries.
* Bullies will transfer their weapon (if they have one) to their inventory so melee practice is fists-only

  - Not all victims will take beatings quietly!

* When bullies are done with bullying, they will re-equip the weapon they transferred to their inventory, **as long as the bullying is not manually interrupted**.

  - If you manually interrupt the bullying, you'll need to transfer the weapon to the bully's equipment manually (drop it on the ground, then equip it).
